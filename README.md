# Energy-Consumption-Prediction

In this project, we compare increasingly complex models to predict energy usage based on building parameters. The most notable model used is the LSTM RNN, which we anticipated to be the most effective method. However, the increased complexity of an RNN did not improve upon the results obtained by the random forest model.
